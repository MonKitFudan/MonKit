# Monkey Track

**MaskTrack R-CNN was used to track monkey’s position (Figure 4C). The rectangle information of the monkey’s position was intercepted and 
input to the HRNet network to obtain the heatmap (Figure 4F and G). The mean square error (MSE) loss function was used to compare the target 
to get loss (Figure 4G). Finally, the 15 bone points were transformed into x and y space coordinates (Figure 4H). The accuracy has reached 98.8% 
accuracy in the MiL2D dataset and OpenMonkeyStudio dataset.**
